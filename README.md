# 🛡️ Sentinel

RBS type signature generator for Rails — Rust-powered, CI-ready.

**Sentinel** keeps your Ruby code and RBS type signatures in perfect sync. It bridges the gap between dynamic Ruby models and static RBS type definitions using a Rust transpiler for speed at scale.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install the Gem
Add Sentinel to your Gemfile:
```
    group :development do
      gem 'sentinel'
    end
```
Then run:
```
    bundle install
```
### 2. Initialize the Project
Run the following command to set up the necessary directories and generate RBS files:
```
    bundle exec sentinel init
```
This creates a `.sentinel.toml` config file (if one doesn't exist) with `app` as the default watched folder, then generates RBS signatures for all Ruby files in it.

### 3. Configure Watched Folders

Sentinel watches the `app` folder by default. Use the CLI to add or remove folders:

```bash
# Add a folder
bundle exec sentinel add lib

# Add another
bundle exec sentinel add config/initializers

# Remove a folder
bundle exec sentinel remove app

# List current configuration
bundle exec sentinel list
```

The configuration is stored in `.sentinel.toml` at your project root:
```toml
folders = ["app", "lib"]
output = "sig/generated"
```

You can also edit this file directly. Sentinel reads it on every `init` and `watch` command.

### 4. Emitting Superclasses (opt-in)

By default a class is emitted without its parent — `class User < ApplicationRecord`
becomes `class User`. Set `emit_superclasses` to keep the parent:

```toml
folders = ["app"]
output = "sig/generated"
emit_superclasses = true
```

```rbs
# emit_superclasses = false (default)      # emit_superclasses = true
class User                                 class User < ApplicationRecord
```

Turn this on when you want Steep to resolve **inherited** methods, class-level DSL
macros and type aliases. Without a parent, every generated class looks like it
inherits from `Object`, so a call to an inherited macro is not merely untyped — Steep
cannot see the method at all, and a `NoMethod` diagnostic is often disabled in
`Steepfile`, so it passes silently.

**It is off by default because it is not a no-op.** Once the parent is visible, Steep
starts checking inherited signatures and will surface pre-existing type errors that
were previously unreachable. That is the point, but it should be a deliberate
migration rather than something a version bump does to you. Expect to fix or
`# steep:ignore` some findings on first enable.

Parents that are not a plain constant path are skipped, since RBS has no way to name
an anonymous class:

```ruby
class Meta < Struct.new(:a, :b)   # emitted as `class Meta` either way
```

A superclass is written exactly as it appears in source. RBS resolves relative to the
enclosing namespace the same way Ruby does, so a relative parent stays relative.

---

## 🔍 Checking Signatures in CI / Pre-commit

Use `sentinel check` to verify that generated RBS files are up to date **without modifying anything**. It exits with code 1 if any signatures are missing or stale.

```bash
bundle exec sentinel check
```

### GitHub Actions

```yaml
- name: Check RBS signatures are up to date
  run: bundle exec sentinel check
```

### Git Pre-commit Hook

Add the following to `.git/hooks/pre-commit` (or use a framework like [Lefthook](https://github.com/evilmartians/lefthook) or [Husky](https://github.com/typicode/husky)):

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -e

bundle exec sentinel check
```

Then make it executable:
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```

If the check fails, run `bundle exec sentinel init` to regenerate, review the changes, and commit again.

---

## 🛠️ Editor Setup

To get live type-checking diagnostics, your editor needs to talk to Steep (the Ruby Type Server), which monitors the signatures Sentinel generates.

### Neovim Setup
Add this to your LSP configuration (e.g., lsp.lua). This ensures Steep is aware of the file changes Sentinel makes in the background.
```
    require('lspconfig').steep.setup({
      cmd = { "bundle", "exec", "steep", "langserver" },
      capabilities = {
        workspace = {
          didChangeWatchedFiles = { dynamicRegistration = true },
        },
      },
      settings = {
        steep = {
          check_on_save = true,
          enable_diagnostics = true,
        }
      }
    })
```
### VS Code Setup
1. Install the Steep VS Code extension.
2. Open your settings.json and ensure it points to your bundled Steep:
```
    {
      "steep.command": "bundle exec steep langserver",
      "steep.enableDiagnostics": true
    }
```
3. Sentinel runs as a separate process; VS Code will automatically pick up the generated .rbs files.

## 🔄 How it Works

Sentinel is designed to be a "set-and-forget" background service:

1. The Watcher: You run 'bundle exec sentinel watch'. It stays active, monitoring your configured folders (default: app).
2. The Transpiler: The moment you save a Ruby file, Sentinel's Rust engine generates a corresponding .rbs file in sig/generated.
3. The Feedback: Your editor (via Steep) sees the new .rbs and immediately updates the diagnostics in your Ruby file.

```
-- Add this to your lsp.lua, outside the return table or inside on_attach
local function start_sentinel()
  if _G.sentinel_job_id then return end -- Don't start it twice

  _G.sentinel_job_id = vim.fn.jobstart({ "bundle", "exec", "sentinel", "watch" }, {
    detach = true, -- Process keeps running in background
    on_stderr = function(_, data)
      -- Optional: print errors to Neovim's :messages if something breaks
      if data and data[1] ~= "" then
        vim.schedule(function()
          vim.notify("Sentinel Error: " .. table.concat(data, "\n"), vim.log.levels.ERROR)
        end)
      end
    end,
    on_exit = function()
      _G.sentinel_job_id = nil
    end,
  })
end

-- Update your steep setup to trigger this
require('lspconfig').steep.setup({
  on_attach = function(client, bufnr)
    start_sentinel()
    -- ... rest of your on_attach
  end,
  -- ... rest of your config
})---
```
## Feature Comparison

Sentinel covers the full rbs-inline annotation surface and is ahead on two items from the [rbs-inline roadmap](https://github.com/soutaro/rbs-inline/wiki/Roadmap):

| Feature | rbs-inline | sentinel |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| Instance methods (`#:`) | ✓ | ✓ |
| Self/class methods | ✓ | ✓ |
| Modules | ✓ | ✓ |
| `attr_reader` / `attr_writer` / `attr_accessor` | ✓ | ✓ |
| Type alias declarations (`# @rbs type`) | not yet | ✓ |
| Overload annotations | not yet | partial (last annotation wins) |
| Shared type imports (`# @rbs import`) | — | ✓ transitive, cycle-safe |
| Header required per file | yes | no |
| Class variables | not yet | not yet |
| Module functions | not yet | not yet |
| Interface declarations | not yet | not yet |
| Class/module aliases | not yet | not yet |

The `# @rbs import <name>` feature is unique to Sentinel: it resolves shared type definitions from `sig/shared/`, walks transitive dependencies in topological order, and handles circular references. rbs-inline has no equivalent.

---

## Performance

Benchmarked on a production Rails app (5,000+ files):

| Tool | Files generated | Time | Peak memory | Header required |
|------|----------------|------|-------------|----------------|
| inline-rbs | 174 | 2.540s | 76.8 MB | yes |
| sentinel | 174 | 306ms | 9.7 MB | no |

~8x faster, ~8x less memory, identical output. Sentinel also requires no opt-in header in each source file, which matters when rolling out type coverage across a large existing codebase or a Rails engine where you don't own every file.

### Watching for changes

**inline-rbs** has no built-in watcher. The recommended approach requires composing three external tools:

```bash
fswatch -0 lib | xargs -0 -n1 bundle exec rbs-inline --output
```

This requires `fswatch` to be installed separately, spawns a new Ruby process on every file save, and is macOS-specific.

**Sentinel** builds and watches in one command:

```bash
bundle exec sentinel
```

The watcher is built into the Rust binary — no extra dependencies, cross-platform, and no per-save process spawn overhead.

---

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

If Steep fails to start with "Exit Code 2", ensure you are running within the correct environment. Sentinel depends on the bundle context to resolve paths correctly. If using asdf or rbenv, ensure your shims are updated:

    asdf reshim ruby
